The Debezium project is conducting our 2024 Community Feedback survey, and we want to hear from YOU!

The survey provides the team with valuable feedback about your past and present Debezium experiences, including what your future needs and goals are around change data capture. This feedback is vital to shape the future roadmap of the project and gives the team direction on the priorities to deliver on the community's needs. The survey will only require a few short minutes of your time, is anonymous, so please, jump right in and get started now!
